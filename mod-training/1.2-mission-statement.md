Our mission statement is clear, Darkstone is "The network made for you."

We want to be the place for friends to gather, collaborate and share what they've made. That's why, like a badge of honor, this statement is displayed proudly on our website, in-game and on Discord. It's the first thing that we want you to know about us.

For our staff members, we want our statement to reflect the fact that *you* help make our network feel unique and personal. The first line of defense for our welcoming environment are the people we pick to moderate our community.

We'll touch more on how you can create these lasting impressions, but in the meantime we want you to be aware of our mission statement.
