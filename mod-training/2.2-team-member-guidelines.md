The rules that govern the expected conduct of our staff members is very simple. An in-depth list of suggested punishments for our server's players is listed [on our website](../hc/rules-and-regulations#punishment-guidelines). For staff members: an offense for staff members is a "bump up" in severity level for regular players.

For example: if an action is a (<span class="severity-1">Severity 1</span>) category offense, for our staff members the same action would be a (<span class="severity-2">Severity 2</span>) category offense.

By progressing to the next item in the content structure, you agree to follow our guidelines for team members and understand moving forward, violations of the server rules are subject to this policy.
