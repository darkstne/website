Endeavor training is divided up into smaller sections called "Modules." This Module is titled "Back to Basics," or more simply, Module 1.

Areas of this Module will focus on the background and values behind Darkstone as a network, the role of Mods as community leaders and general background-ish information. Most importantly, this Module will outline how you will "fit in" specifically to the network.
