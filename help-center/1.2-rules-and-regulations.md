Our community's rules is how we keep things organized and make sure that everyone is doing what they're supposed to. If you notice that someone is in violation of the rules, you should follow the [reporting procedures](#reporting).

## Community guidelines
Our community guidelines are the ones that you can see on our [rules page](../rules). These guidelines are general, overall rules to help guide our members on how to conduct themselves in a way that we think should and shouldn't be allowed on our services. In most cases, if you don't think your conduct fits all of our "big five," it probably isn't allowed.

## Punishment guidelines
The server's punishment guidelines is what our staff members use to help determine the severity of rule breaking, and to aid them with issuing punishments of a certain duration. Not all cases fit the punishment guidelines, which is why we allow our staff members wiggle room to interpret a punishment's severity.

If you believe your punishment was too strict or in error, you are entitled to file an [appeal](#appealing).

### Disclosure for guidelines
As said earlier; staff members are not required, nor shouldn't, follow any of these guidelines strictly. Blindly following the law without room for interpretation *will* result in unfair punishments and should be avoided.

Certain punishments will also have certain punishments specified for an action **in bold lettering.** Staff members are expected to only use the suggested moderation as it has been approved and considered for the offense. This should only be the case if the action is in black and white and requires no interpretation from the staff member.

Repeat offenses and violations of rules of any severity will result in a "bump" to the next severity level. Staff members are also given discretion here when determining additional severity levels to apply to an offense.

### <span style="color: #239B56">Severity 1</span>
Offenses considered "Severity 1" are typically minor infractions with very light enforcement. Punishments for these offenses will typically result in a verbal warning from a staff member, a kick or temporary mute.

#### Global guidelines
* Minor chat spam. Repeating three or up to five messages consecutively to fill up the chat. **Verbal warning and or mute < 24 hours.**
* Privacy invasions. Teleporting to players without their permission specifically to invade their privacy and disrupt other members. **Verbal warning and or kick.**
* Unsuitable nicknames. Using a nickname that contains phrases or terms to suggest that one is a staff member or holds a titular position. This includes the following below in addition to obvious titles meant to convey a position that are not listed. **Verbal warning and nickname removal.**
