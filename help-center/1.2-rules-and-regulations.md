Our community's rules is how we keep things organized and make sure that everyone is doing what they're supposed to. If you notice that someone is in violation of the rules, you should follow the [reporting procedures](#reporting).

## Community guidelines
Our community guidelines are the ones that you can see on our [rules page](../rules).

These guidelines are designed to be short and memorable for everyone to judge their conduct on the server and whether their actions are helping or hurting the community. In most cases, if you don't think your conduct fits all of our "big five," it probably isn't allowed.

## Punishment guidelines
The server's punishment guidelines is what our staff members use to help determine the severity of rule breaking, and to aid them with issuing punishments of a certain duration. Not all cases fit the punishment guidelines, which is why we allow our staff members wiggle room to interpret a punishment's severity. Staff members are not required, nor shouldn't, follow any of these guidelines without regards to context. Staff members are expected to be interpretative, since otherwise it *will* result in unfair punishments.

Players are entitled to file an appeal for non-network offenses. If you believe your punishment was unfairly issued, and you believe it should be reduced or removed, follow the [appealing](#appealing) procedures.

### Additional guidelines information
Repeat offenses and violations of rules of any severity will result in a "bump" to the next severity level. Staff members are also given discretion here when determining additional severity levels to apply to an offense.

Staff members are not able to apply punishment durations on their own since it is decided by the system. Punishment lengths will increase depending on repeat offenses and increased severity levels.

### Chat offenses
Staff members are required to issue a verbal warning for all <span class="severity-1">Severity 1</span> offenses. If you have a previous violation of the same rule of any severity, an additional warning is not required before punishment.
