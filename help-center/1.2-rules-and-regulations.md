Our community's rules is how we keep things organized and make sure that everyone is doing what they're supposed to. If you notice that someone is in violation of the rules, you should follow the [reporting procedures](#report).

## Community guidelines
Our community guidelines are the ones that you can see on our [rules page](../rules). These guidelines are general, overall rules to help guide our members on how to conduct themselves in a way that we think should and shouldn't be allowed on our services. In most cases, if you don't think your conduct fits all of our "big five," it probably isn't allowed.

## Punishment guidelines
The server's punishment guidelines is what our staff members use to help determine the severity of rule breaking, and to aid them with issuing punishments of a certain duration. Not all cases fit the punishment guidelines, which is why we allow our staff members wiggle room to interpret a punishment's severity.

If you believe your punishment was too strict or in error, you are entitled to file an [appeal](#appeal).
