## Server membership
All of our players are eligible, and encouraged to, apply for server membership/residency. The "member" role is awarded to trusted members of the community who aren't an [Architect](../#) or [staff member](../staff) and would like to access member-only features.

Members are held to more strict interpretations of the server rules, with a zero tolerance policy in terms of editing other user's content and griefing. This information can be viewed specifically on our [member help section](../#) of the server's help center.

Some features available to server members include:
* Access to private Creative worlds: Rhodesia and Moesia
* Member role on server Discord
* Member-only private Discord channel and project planning area
* Joining server priority
