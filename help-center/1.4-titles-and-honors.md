We offer a variety of titles to honor our players and thank them for their continued loyalty and support of the community.

Our titles usually are awarded to players and are not typically applied for. That being said, players can apply for some titles when applicable.

## Voting titles
As a way to advertise the server and attract new unique players every day, we list the server on "voting" websites so players can submit a "vote" and push the server to the top of the page. This means that the more votes we get, the better the chance we have to be recognized. As a result, we offer [voting rewards](../vote) for our players and staff members that submit votes for us.

## Server membership
All of our players are eligible, and encouraged to apply for server residency. The "member" role is awarded to trusted members of the community who aren't an [Architect](../#) or [staff member](../staff) and would like to access member-only features.

Members are held to more strict interpretations of the server rules, with a zero tolerance policy in terms of editing other user's content and griefing. This information can be viewed specifically on our [member help section](../#) of the server's help center.

Some features available to server members include:
* Access to private Creative worlds: Rhodesia and Moesia
* Member role on server Discord
* Member-only private Discord channel and project planning area
* Joining server priority

In-game, Members will have a <span style="color: #515a5a">[</span><span style="color: #AD1457">M</span><span style="color: #515a5a">]</span> prefix and a <span style="color: #E91E63">magenta</span> name.

## Building titles
In recognition of the skill and achievements of some of the server's best architects and redstone engineers, we award the Architect and Engineer role to them. We don't award this title lightly, and most of our players who've been awarded the title have won a challenging competition or have wowed us with their server creations.

None of our players with a building title are required to build for us. In fact, we discourage it. We think that they should continue to work on projects that they're passionate about, rather than something we've asked them to make for us.

Some features available to our building titles include:
* Increased WorldEdit limit; there isn't one!
* All membership perks
* Build access in the server's staffworld
* VoxelSniper permissions (coming soon!)

### Architect
This is our "brick and mortar"-oriented building title. Architects build using anything from the inventory menu but the redstone section. If you see one of our players with this title while you're playing, they're some of the best of the best the server has to offer. Our architecture program and building events has meant that the server is able to offer unique and captivating spawns for our servers and worlds for our players.

In-game, Architects will have a <span style="color: #515a5a">[</span><span style="color: #21618C">A</span><span style="color: #515a5a">]</span> prefix and a <span style="color: #3498db">light blue</span> name.

<a class="button button--outline-primary button--rounded" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/#/">Apply for Architect</a>

### Engineer
The sister title to Architect, this is our title we specifically award to the server's redstoners. While the redstone blocks the game offers are few, the skill and complexity involved with complex redstone creations commands admiration of its own. It's a lot more than an AND logic gate; it's in-game calculators and flying machines.

In-game, Engineers will have a <span style="color: #515a5a">[</span><span style="color: #21618C">E</span><span style="color: #515a5a">]</span> prefix and a <span style="color: #3498db">light blue</span> name.

<a class="button button--outline-primary button--rounded" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/#/">Apply for Engineer</a>

## Administrative titles
In addition to the titles we offer for all of our players, we also have specific titles we give our staff members for organizational and honorific purposes. These titles are not open to the general public, and staff members are not able to apply for them.

### Operations Director
The Operations Directors are [Admins](../hc/content-moderation#admins) who have been assigned to direct the operations of the server they've been assigned to. This includes:
* Reviewing player feedback. Our players and other staff members often submit their feedback for server improvements. The Operations Directors and Executives work together to review feedback and to continue providing new and captivating features to our servers.
* Identify and address issues. Find areas where we could be running a server more efficiently, monitor a server's performance or improve the experience for our players.
* Looking forward. Analyze upcoming features and changes to the game or other plugins that should be implemented in the future and to guide a server moving forward.

Presently we have three servers, each of which has its own Operations Director. Each director will have a role ending in "Operations" on the forum and Discord server.

### Associate
The "associate" title is another one of our administrative titles that is always bundled with a rank, they come in pairs. Generally speaking, the server's associates have attained the honor and status of the position they're an associate of, but due to there being no vacancy, the staff member is being trained or otherwise or something else, that staff member is an "Associate".

#### Associate Executives
