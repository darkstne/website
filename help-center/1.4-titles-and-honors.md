We offer a variety of titles to honor our members and thank them for their continued loyalty and support of the community.

Our titles usually are awarded to members, not applied for. That being said, members can apply for some titles when applicable.

## Server membership
All of our players are eligible, and encouraged to, apply for server residency. The "member" role is awarded to trusted members of the community who aren't an [Architect](../#) or [staff member](../staff) and would like to access member-only features.

Members are held to more strict interpretations of the server rules, with a zero tolerance policy in terms of editing other user's content and griefing. This information can be viewed specifically on our [member help section](../#) of the server's help center.

Some features available to server members include:
* Access to private Creative worlds: Rhodesia and Moesia
* Member role on server Discord
* Member-only private Discord channel and project planning area
* Joining server priority

In-game, Members will have a <span style="color: #515a5a">[</span><span style="color: #AD1457">M</span><span style="color: #515a5a">]</span> prefix and a <span style="color: #E91E63">light magenta</span> name.

## Building titles
In recognition of the skill and achievements of some of the server's best architects and redstone engineers, we award the Architect and Engineer role to them. We don't award this title lightly, and most of our members who've been awarded the title have won a challenging competition or have wowed us with their server creations.

None of our members with a building title are required to build for us. In fact, we discourage it. We think that they should continue to work on projects that they're passionate about, rather than something we've asked them to make for us.

Some features available to our building titles include:
* Increased WorldEdit limit; there isn't one!
* Permanent perks for members
* Build access in the server's staffworld
* VoxelSniper permissions (coming soon!)

### Architect
This is our "brick and mortar"-oriented building title. Architects build using anything from the inventory menu but the redstone section. If you see one of our members with this title while you're playing, they're some of the best of the best the server has to offer. Our architecture program and building events has meant that the server is able to offer unique and captivating spawns for our servers and worlds to our members.

In-game, Architects will have a <span style="color: #21618C">[</span><span style="color: #AD1457">A</span><span style="color: #515a5a">]</span> prefix and a <span style="color: #3498db">light blue</span> name.

<a class="button button--outline-primary button--rounded" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/#/">Apply for Architect</a>

### Engineer
The sister title to Architect, this is our title we specifically award to the server's redstoners. While the redstone blocks the game offers are few, the skill and complexity involved with complex redstone creations commands admiration of its own. It's a lot more than an AND logic gate; it's in-game calculators and flying machines.

In-game, Engineers will have a <span style="color: #21618C">[</span><span style="color: #AD1457">E</span><span style="color: #515a5a">]</span> prefix and a <span style="color: #3498db">light blue</span> name.
