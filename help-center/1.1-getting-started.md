Our help center is the place where any of our members can learn anything and everything there is to know about the server. This page will help you get started with connecting to the server and joining our community.

> Some of the information covered in our help center will feel, as times, as a repeat of some of the information we have in other sections on the website. Note that pages like our "rules" and "worlds" are designed for easy and quick reference, and the help center is to be used for in-depth reading and reference. The help center is not designed to replace these pages, but instead to add to the availability of information.

## In-game network
Our in-game Minecraft network is the heart of our community and is where most of the action happens. As a result, it's good to know how to use the features we offer on the server to get around.

### Connecting
We support the latest [Minecraft Java](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition) version (at the time of updating, 1.16.2) up until client 1.4.7. For the best experience, we recommend joining with 1.16.2.

To begin, select "Multiplayer" on the Minecraft home screen. We're considered a "third party server" to the game, and to access Darkstone you might have to acknowledge an agreement to begin playing depending on what version you're using.

You can use the "Add Server" button or "Direct Connect" to join us, either works. Use the address `darkst.one` to join the server. If for whatever reason this address isn't working, `play.darkst.one` should always provide a direct line to the server. No port is required to join the server on Java edition.

#### Connecting on Bedrock
We specified "Java version" above because you can also join us using Minecraft Bedrock edition. This includes the [Windows 10](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-windows10) edition, as well as the [iOS](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-ios) and [Andriod](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-android) versions. The console editions of the game unfortunately do not support entering a custom server address.

To begin, select "Play" on the Minecraft home screen. Select the tab on the top right called "Servers". You can then scroll to the bottom of the page to "Additional Servers" and there should be a button that allows you to add a server. In the "Server Address" field, use the address `play.darkst.one`. The address `darkst.one` will not work for Bedrock. The port should be defaulted to `19132`. Then press "Save".

Once you have added the server to your list and connected to the server, you will be prompted to enter your Java Edition account credentials to connect. You must have a Java Edition account to sign in to in order to connect to the server using Bedrock Edition.
