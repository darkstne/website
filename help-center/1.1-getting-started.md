Our help center is the place where any of our members can learn anything and everything there is to know about the server. This page will help you get started with connecting to the server and joining our community.

> Some of the information covered in our help center will feel, as times, a repeat of some of the information we have in other sections on the website. Note that pages like our "rules" and "worlds" are designed for easy and quick reference, and the help center is to be used for in-depth reading and reference. The help center is not designed to replace these pages, but instead to add to the availability of information.

## Server basics
Our in-game Minecraft network is the heart of our community and is where most of the action happens. As a result, it's good to know how to use the features we offer on the server to get around.

We run the [BungeeCord Proxy](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) in order to link our servers together as a network. The servers themselves use the [Paper](https://papermc.io/) server software to run Spigot plugins and for server operations.

### Joining the network

We support the latest [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition) version (at the time of writing, 1.16.2) up until client 1.4.7. As the game updates, we may drop support for older client versions. For the best experience, we recommend joining with 1.16.2.

To begin, select "Multiplayer" on the Minecraft home screen. We're considered a "third party server" to the game, and to access Darkstone you might have to acknowledge an agreement to begin playing depending on what version you're using.

You can use the "Add Server" button or "Direct Connect" to join us. In the "Server Address" box, use the address `darkst.one` to join the server. If for whatever reason this address isn't working, `play.darkst.one` should always provide a direct line to the server. No port is required to join the server on Java Edition.

#### Joining on Bedrock
We specified "Java Edition" above since we also support connecting using Minecraft Bedrock Edition. This includes the [Windows 10](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-windows10) edition, as well as the [iOS](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-ios) and [Android](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-android) versions. The console editions of the game unfortunately do not support entering a custom server address.

Our Bedrock Edition support is provided by the [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/) project so that Java Edition and Bedrock Edition players are able to play together.

To begin, select "Play" on the Minecraft home screen and then select the tab on the top right called "Servers". You can then scroll to the bottom of the page to "Additional Servers" and there should be a button that allows you to add a server. In the "Server Address" box, use the address `play.darkst.one`. The address `darkst.one` will not work for Bedrock. The port should be defaulted to `19132`. You should then press "Save".

Once you have added the server to your list and connected to the server, you will be prompted to enter your Java Edition account credentials to connect. You must have a Java Edition account to sign in to in order to connect to the server using Bedrock Edition.

## Basic commands
Minecraft supports "commands" in order to help navigate around the server, see who's online and to interact with other players. These commands are good to know so that you know how to get around the server and find what you need.

### Bungee navigation
Once connected on first login you will spawn in on our Lobby server. This is our bridge to all of our other servers. Our chat across the Network is global, and members from other servers might welcome you to the server.

You have a few ways in which you can access our servers. In your inventory on the Lobby you'll be given a piece of paper labeled "Server Selector" which you can click to access our servers. Alternatively you can use `/menu` to access the server selector.

You may also run the name of the server you wish to connect to as a command. For example, you can connect to Survival using `/survival`. `/server <name>` can also be used for the same function.

### Checking other players
On the server of your choice, we offer a number of commands that show server information or to see who's online. These commands in addition to the tab list can show who is online. We recommend using the tablist to see other players since it will group them by server and show online members across the network.
* `/list` - Shows all members online on the server you're connected to
* `/whois <name>` - View player information, location, gamemode
* `/realname <name>` - Identify someone who has a nickname

You can also find members close to you using radar commands.
* `/radar` - See other members' proximity to you in meters
* `/near` or `/nearby` - Aliases and duplicates of the command above

### Server statistics and worlds
We use the [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/) suite of plugins and their libraries to provide memory statistics and world information through commands.
* `/mem` - Displays server memory and loaded worlds
* `/tps` - Ticks per second reports, the "lag level" on the server
