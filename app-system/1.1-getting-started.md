Welcome to the Darkstone Application System (DAS). This is the place where you'll find all of the positions we allow our players to submit applications for. You're probably here since you're interested in one of the server's staff member ranks or titles.

In that case, let's get started.

## System navigation
Make use of the navigation menu on the left hand side of this page in order to learn more and find out what you're applying for. Before applying, the page will also tell you about specific requirements for a position that you should be able to meet before submitting your application.

If you do not meet any of the requirements the system asks for, do not submit an application until you are able to meet these requirements.

## Irregularities and questions
We're all human here (or most of us, at least) and make mistakes. If you notice that an application question seems incorrect or reads a bit weirdly, feel free to reach out to a staff member and let them know what the issue was.

Also, if a question is hard to understand or doesn't make sense, please reach out as well. We will work to make sure this question is easier to understand for any other members who will be submitting the same form in the future.
