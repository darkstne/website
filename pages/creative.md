The Creative server is our answer for a proper place to create and to collaborate in the Creative gamemode.

All of our players, member or not, are given access to an advanced suite of WorldEdit commands, and multiple public worlds to build and explore. Both of our plotworlds and "Sandbox" superflat testing world are available and geared toward the public.

## Worlds
We offer a total of eight different worlds for creativity. Each of them has their own purpose and intended use for our members to take advantage of their creative permissions.

### Sandbox
"Sandbox" is the name we've given to our superflat, public testing world. If you're familiar with free-op style servers, this is our "flatlands" world for fun and unserious building.

#### How do I access the sandbox?
The sandbox is open to the public and no member application is necessary. On the Creative server you may run `/public` or `/sandbox` in order to access the world.

### Rhodesia
"Rhodesia" is the name we've given to our superflat, member-only city build world for the seriously creative. Our members can establish towns, cities and settlements with no restrictions from us as long as it keeps in line with our rules. There isn't a protection plugin, claims system or restricted areas.

#### How do I access Rhodesia?
You must have applied and been approved for membership before being able to access Rhodesia. Once approved, on the Creative server you may run `/private` or `/rhodesia` in order to access the world.

#### How do I get started?
As one of our member-only worlds, members of the public must apply for building rights in Rhodesia.

> Note: Members are required to follow more strict server rules when it comes to editing others' builds and griefing. Read the rules of membership status on our [help center](../hc).
