The Creative server is our answer for a proper place to create and to collaborate in the Creative gamemode.

All of our players, member or not, are given access to an advanced suite of WorldEdit commands, and multiple public worlds to build and explore. Both of our plotworlds and "Sandbox" superflat testing world are available and geared toward the public.

We usually use a [grass block](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Grass_Block) from the game to identify the Creative server.

## Worlds
We offer a total of eight different worlds for creativity. Each of them has their own purpose and intended use for our members to take advantage of their creative permissions.

### Sandbox
"Sandbox" is the name we've given to our superflat, public testing world. If you're familiar with free-op style servers, this is our "flatlands" world for fun and unserious building.

Due to the nature of the sandbox, this world is automatically reset and wiped clean periodically. We'll give you a heads up when this happens.

#### How do I access the sandbox?
The sandbox is open to the public and no member application is necessary. On the Creative server you may run `/public` or `/sandbox` in order to access the world.

### Plot worlds
Our plot worlds are filled with square plots that our members can claim. It's like the sandbox but sectioned off, and nobody can edit your claims unless you give them access.

The plot worlds on the server come in two sizes, 85x85 and 251x251. We run the [PlotSquared](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/PlotSquared) plugin for plot management.

#### How do I access the plot worlds?
The plot worlds are open to the public and no member application is necessary. On the Creative server you may run `/public` or `/plots85` and `/plots251` in order to access the respective worlds.

#### How do I get started?
Once you are in a plot world, you can use `/plotme auto` in order to be teleported to and to claim a plot automatically. No effort required. However, if there's a plot in particular that you want to claim, and nobody has already, stand in the plot and run `/p claim`. This will make the plot yours.

To add someone to your plot so they can edit it, there are a few options.
* To add someone with build access **only when the plot owner is online** use `/plot add <player>`.
* To add someone with build access **when the plot owner is online or offline** use `/plot trust <player>`.

This can be undone by using `/plot remove <player>`.

Further instructions for using the plot plugin can be found by visiting our [help center](../hc).

### Rhodesia
We call our superflat, member-only city build world "Rhodesia" that is designed for the seriously creative. Our members can establish towns, cities and settlements with no restrictions from us as long as it keeps in line with our rules. There isn't a protection plugin, claims system or restricted areas.

#### How do I access Rhodesia?
You must have applied and been approved for membership before being able to access Rhodesia. Once approved, on the Creative server you may run `/private` or `/rhodesia` in order to access the world.

#### How do I get started?
As one of our member-only worlds, members of the public must apply for building rights in Rhodesia.

> Note: Members are required to follow more strict server rules when it comes to editing others' builds and griefing. Read the rules of membership status on our [help center](../hc).

### Moesia
We call the vanilla-style overworld "Moesia" with vanilla terrain and village generation. Much like Rhodesia, our members can also establish towns and cities, and shape the world to their liking. There isn't a protection plugin here either, and members manage their own claims.

#### How do I access Moesia?
You must have applied and been approved for membership before being able to access Moesia. Once approved, on the Creative server you may run `/private` or `/moesia` in order to access the world.

#### How do I get started?
As one of our member-only worlds, members of the public must apply for building rights in Moesia.
