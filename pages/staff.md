## Staff team
Our server staff members are appointed to make sure everything is in line ðŸ‘Œ with the server's rules. Every member of the team is selected to be an enforcer of the rules and someone who supports the community. This page will provide the general role of each rank, and how to get in contact with each member.

Executives are responsible for the server's operations. They focus on maintaining the server both in the short-term and also focusing on the long-term goals of the project. They oversee issues that affect the community and are the final interpreters of the server's rules. They are also responsible for paying for the server's hosting and domain(s). In short, they do almost everything.

Developers are responsible for writing and maintaining custom applications and software that the server utilizes. Such as our [custom Discord bot](https://github.com/darkstne/bot). They are also responsible for the server's backend, to keep software up to date, maintain the webserver and the various running applications on the server's virtual machine. They are granted every permission on the server to adequately test new plugins.
