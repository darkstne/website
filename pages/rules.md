We have a set of five, general and memorable rules that all players should know when talking with others and being on our platforms. These rules are designed to keep everyone polite, respectful, but most importantly, safe. By joining any of our platforms you agree that you will follow these rules.

These "big five" community guidelines are not all-inclusive, but are for our players on how to judge their conduct. An in-depth punishment guidelines that outlines general punishment lengths for various offenses against our rules can be viewed on the server's [help center](../hc/rules-and-regulations#punishment-guidelines).

## Golden rule

### 1. Comply with staff members
Comply with all of the requests of staff members, and be truthful and forthcoming with anything they might ask.

<details>
  <summary>Why have this rule?</summary>
      <p>The goal of staff members is to keep the community a safe place and promote an enjoyable experience for all of our players. When everyone cooperates with staff members, they are better able to keep the community secure.</p>
      <p>Staff members will never ask for personal information or any credentials to your account. File a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/report">report</a> immediately if this happens.</p>
</details>

<details>

      <p>All of our staff members act with the whole community in mind. Try to assist by doing the following:</p>
