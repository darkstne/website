## Nothing but features
Supporting Minecraft 1.16.5 up until version 1.4.7. We offer:
* Full Minecraft Bedrock support. Really. Join using [your phone](../hc/getting-started#joining-on-bedrock) and play with Minecraft Java Edition players in real time.
* Private and public worlds. Create and collaborate in worlds without protection and those with the highest walls you can get, all on the same server.
* PvE that you want to play on. No learning how to use a protection plugin, our staff members got you covered. Survive and thrive without any need to figure out "how do I protect this again?"
* A staff team that has your back. Most of us have years under our belts and have your issue covered. If one person doesn't know; we have two other members who do.
* Hard work earns rewards. Those who go above and beyond for our community have [something to show for it](../hc/titles-and-honors), and you can too.

## Getting creative wheels spinning
How we work, collaborate, provide support, and go about making changes is founded in our mission statement.

> The network made for you.

We've set out to create a modern, supportive, and secure environment for everyone's creative side. No matter your qualifications, everyone can jump right in and become an active player in the community.
