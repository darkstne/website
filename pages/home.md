## Getting creative wheels spinning
How we work, collaborate, provide support, and go about making changes is founded in our mission statement.

We've set out to create a modern, supportive, and secure environment for everyone's creative side. No matter your qualifications, everyone can jump right in and become an active member of the community.

## What's the latest?
Understand how we're moving to be better as a server and as a creative group by keeping yourself updated, and by keeping tabs on how to remain involved.
