It's like survival, but it's in the air. Oh, and there's no ground for you to fall on.

All of the server's players can get started building and expanding their own sky island base. Build all by yourself or with friends, everyone starts with an oak tree and a chest. It's skyblock how you know it, and that's why we like it.

We usually use [oak leaves](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Leaves) from the game to identify the Skyblock server.
