To put it simply, our goal is to provide our community with a place to express themselves using the latest tools available to Minecraft servers. Everyone is able to claim a plot, start a survival community or use WorldEdit. Turning it up to 11, our server's members have access to private build worlds, enchanced WorldEdit permissions and priority for joining the server. Click [here](../) to learn about becoming a member of the server.
