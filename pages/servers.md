To put it simply, our goal is to provide our community with a place to express themselves using the latest tools available to Minecraft servers. Everyone is able to claim a plot, start a survival community or use WorldEdit. Turning it up to 11, our server's members have access to private build worlds, enchanced WorldEdit permissions and priority for joining the server.

      <p>The Creative server features WorldEdit and OP-style permissions while offering two large plotworlds and a "Sandbox" superflat testing world. Everyone gets access to nicknames, WorldEdit, warps and homes and can vote for additional cosmetic privileges. For our members, we have the private "Rhodesia" superflat build world, the "Moesia" vanilla-style build world, and enhanced WorldEdit permissions.</p>

    <div class="item__description">
      <p>The Survival server features a public, survival multiplayer and player-versus-environment style survival world focused around community and collaboration in a semi-vanilla environment. Players are able to create, build-- thrive together without fear of raids or looting. Everyone gets access to chest and inventory block locking to prevent theft. We offer custom crafting recipes, warps and homes, and everyone can vote for additional cosmetic privileges.</p>

    <div class="item__description">
      <p>The Skyblock server features a survival world focused around a floating island in the sky with nothing but a tree and some grass. Players are able to build and collaborate on their own or with others to progress and make their islands bigger and better. Much like the Survival server, we offer many custom crafting recipes all in a semi-vanilla environment, just without the world generation.</p>

## Network conduct
For our members, we have a [server rules page](../rules) of the server's global community guidelines to help players conduct themselves with a few, short and memorable rules. This page is kept up-to-date with the latest changes to our guidelines, and we'll always let you know when something changes.

An in-depth punishment guidelines that staff members use for specific offenses and circumstances on the server can be found by using the server's [help center](../hc/rules-and-regulations#punishment-guidelines).
